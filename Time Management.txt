“Time Monsters”: 
Distractions 
Multi-tasking 
Procrastination 
------------------------------------------------------------
A distraction is something that prevents you from giving your attention to 
an area of focus

If we can identify our biggest time monsters - the activities or situations
that throw us off course, distract or interrupt us, or the bad habits that keep us from planning better 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Big Rocks
Steven Covey, author of “The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People” is famous for this “Big Rocks” Demonstration. 
This simple technique reveals a hidden formula for creating the work life balance we all 
seek by scheduling your Big Rocks First. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you DON’T schedule your Big Rocks, here’s what usually happens -> NOTHING!

You might not take that vacation with friends. 
You may not hit the gym or exercise regularly. 
You may not learn a new language or skill. 
You may not practice your dance or art or music.
You might not spend as much time as you would like with your family
You are equally responsible for your personal life as your professional life

1.Start with simple questions
Who are the most important people in your life?
What would you like to do more of with them? 
What are the most exciting items on your Bucket List? 
What interests do you want to build more on? 

2.Schedule them and do it
If you schedule them and do it, here's what usually happens:
Your work life might get highly structured and scheduled. 
Most professionals may not have the same degree of structure when it comes to their life outside of work.
Rather than do your job and simply HOPE that your life can squeeze in around the edges, 
build your own work life balance structure that runs parallel to your work schedule

3.Defend your big rocks
Put your Big Rocks on your Calendar
Hold this Schedule
Consider this time blocked out 
Keep all your appointments for your Self

Time Management Matrix - Eisenhower-Covey Matrix 

One of the reasons for wasting time is that we are so busy,
that we can only focus on the most urgent things and all the minor distractions that 
come our way throughout the day. We forget the things that may be less urgent but are
nevertheless important.

**************************************************************************
Q1: Firefighting
Necessity
Crisis, Pressing Issues, Deadline-driven projects, Escalations

Q2: Quality Time
Productivity
Preparation, Prevention, Planning, Relation-building

Q3: Distraction
Not Important
Deception
Needless interruptions, unnecessary meetings/reports/email, minor project details

Q4: Wasting Time
Excess
Passive ‘world watching’, shows, unchallenged routines, games, consuming nonsense trivia,
Shopping, Social Media

***************************************************************************************
Multi-tasking can cause a 40% increase in mistakes, waste as much as 2.1 hours in a typical day!
Studies show that our brains are not nearly as good at handling multiple tasks as we like to think they are
When interrupted while performing on a task, it takes an employee an average of 25 minutes to regain focus

Let's explore two strategies that can be used instead of multi-tasking: 
1. Chunking - Eat the Elephant
2. The Pomodoro Technique

Chunking - Eat the Elephant
the best way to do something is to break it up into smaller pieces or chunks. 

So, what is better than multitasking? Chunking is better for productivity. 
This 'divide and conquer' strategy means that you won't tackle things that are too big, a real motivation drainer!
A ‘chunked to-do’ list with a set time for each block is helpful
The more chunks of time you can devote to specific tasks, the fewer start-stop moments you will have. 
**************************************************************************************************
Pomodoro Technique
Do you have lots of open-ended work that could take unlimited amounts of time?
Start thinking of your time in terms of tomatoes rather than hours.
Pomodoro is Italian for tomato.

Step 1: Get a to-do list and a timer.
Step 2: Set your timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the timer rings.
Step 3: When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro and record what you completed.
Step 4: Then enjoy a five-minute break.
Step 5: After four pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 15-30 minute break.

1 Pomodoro = 25 min of focus work + 5 min break
**********************************************************************************************************

Decoding Procrastination
Simply put, procrastination is the act of putting off or delaying tasks until the last minute. 

Thus, Procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, not a time management problem​. ​
If its repeated constantly, it can have serious effects on our mental and physical health and life satisfaction  

Productivity is an average measure of the efficiency expressed as the ratio of output to inputs. 

Personal productivity is completing the actions that move you closer to accomplishing your goals in a manner
 that brings balance and ease into your life

4 sources of energy:physical,emotional,mental,spiritual
------------------------------------------------------------
In today’s hectic virtual world, the workplace too often seems like an emotional roller coaster. Long hours, 
tight deadlines, and ever-increasing demands can leave you feeling worried, drained, and overwhelmed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That’s what we do with tasks and time organisation
OK, sometimes we have to juggle different tasks and activities
So, what is better than multitasking? Chunking is better for productivity. 
This 'divide and conquer' strategy means that you won't tackle things that are too big, a real motivation drainer!
A ‘chunked to-do’ list with a set time for each block is helpful

Q) Let's learn three strategies to help us stop procrastinating: 
Parkinson's Law
Eat the Frog
Golden Key 



Parkinson's law: If you give a task 5 hours, it will take 5 hours to complete. But if you give that same task 5 days,
 it will take 5 days to complete it.

By using Parkinson’s Law correctly, you can get more done in less time and learn how much time each of your tasks really requires. 
************************************************************************************************************
Eat the frog
what is your "frog"? What is the one task that you despise doing that day? Do your hardest, most important task first thing in the morning. 

Benefeits:
t leads to an increase in your day’s productivity
It gives you a feeling of accomplishment
Positive Addiction - endorphins are released to completed tasks
It promotes a deep work habit

*******************************************************************************************
Golden Key

It’s challenging to be productive and succeed in a new role if we are not clear of what is expected of us.
knowing able willing allowed

Saying no is NOT 
Selfish
Rude
Wrong
Saying no to others is saying yes to yourself!
---------------------------------------------------
De-Clutter for Energy
The F.A.S.T Method
This clutter principle means that each item that you decide to keep has a deliberate and purposeful existence 
to help you to achieve vision that you are building towards
Fix a Time
Anything not used recently 
Someone else’s/ Some other clutter
Trash
-----------------------------------------
The Final Step is to Do It! 
Live Light - Declutter your Desk, Inbox, Repository, Task list, People Circle, Home, 
Having a solid support system at work can help buffer you from the negative effects of job stress.
Rapport Building

Rapport occurs when two or more people feel that they are “in sync” or “on the same wavelength”
because they feel similar or relate well to each other.

Common Ground
Common ground is a topic, opinion, or interest that two or more people can agree about. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rapport(cground)-comfort(mutual a)-poisitivity(cooperation)-collaboration(trust)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sooner or later someone or something will try to displace one of our Big Rocks. For example: 
Unplanned meetings
Unscheduled tasks
Last-minute changes 
Requests for support 
Overheads
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you build common ground?
Just a ‘hi’ or ‘how are you’ is not going to cut it.
You can open the conversation in a better way: ‘So what’s new in the past week?’
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When asked something specific on an online chat, it is easier to interpret it, as
 it does not sound vague, overcoming the handicap of lack of visual/body language cues.

Ensure the topics do not include negative gossip or complaints, as these conversations 
are unprofessional and on record in the organisation.
